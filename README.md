# Semantic-Feature-Extraction-from-Image-Data
A deep learning-based system to automatically predict numerical attributes (e.g., weight, length) from product images using ResNet50, built with PyTorch. This project extracts visual features from product images and estimates entity values like weight or size along with their units â€” a crucial task for e-commerce cataloging and data validation.
